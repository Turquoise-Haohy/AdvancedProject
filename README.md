# AdvancedProject

## Introduction

This is the final Advanced Project of Turbi. Here I conclude my one-year practitioning in psychogeography combining machine learning and poetic coding to build an AR experience.
The process would be arrange as following: 
* Planning Status( Data Collecting, 
* Design Status
* Test Status

## Methods
Methodology: Constructivism, Psychogeography, Poetic Coding
Tools: MachineLearning(StyleGAN2), Unity(Vuforia), MapBox(GoMap), Blender

##Process
###Plannning Status
1. Whiteboard BrainStorming
2. Searching for related literature narration and Projects
3. Collecting maps, based on which I construct my life, preparing for the poetic coding
4. Filtering photos and looking for prototypes, recording my emotions and behaviors

###Design Status
1. Using maps as dataset for machine training
2. Modeling prototypes in blender
3. Test AR(Vuforia AR Foundation), Looking for method to embed maps in unity APP.
4. Building UI/UX prototypes of my AR APP
5. Complete all the scenes of the Unity App

###Test Status
1. Usability Test
2. Get feedback and make iteration Plan
